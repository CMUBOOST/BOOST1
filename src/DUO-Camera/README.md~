ROS Driver for DUO3D (http://duo3d.com/) cameras. 

**NOTE:** 

To stay up to date with the latest (required) SDK do the following: 
- `unset DUO_SDK` (unset the enviornment variable if previously set)
- `catkin_make`
- The setup_duo script will then execute
- After it's finished, **it will print the path** to where the new downloaded DUOSDK now is
- Copy the command **from the log**: `export DUO_SDK=/path/to/catkin_ws/devel/DUOSDK`
- Paste it into your `~/.bashrc`


BOOST Instructions:

Download the ZIP file for the DUO Dashboard from the DUO website
Open the install guide as well
Check kernel version on Ubuntu using uname -r, and make sure the corresponding driver is available
Install the 512 version, I had some issues with 1024 in the past (although that might have been because I was a noob)

Install stereo image processing from http://wiki.ros.org/stereo_image_proc

Put the DUO Camera folder in the src folder, which should be located in catkin_ws (or BOOST1 in my case)

Update the bashrc (with the "export" command as outlined above)

Edit the CMakeLists.txt to manually direct the script to the location of your SDK folder (for example /home/boost-1/Documents/CL-DUO3D-LIN-1.0.50.26/DUOSDK/SDK)

To run the launch file and view disparity image:
	- source devel/setup.bash
	- roslaunch duo.launch (this should publish a lot of ros topics)
	- ROS_NAMESPACE=duo3d_camera rosrun stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc
	- rosrun image_view stereo_view stereo:=duo3d_camera image:=image_rect

To view the point cloud:
	- launch duo.launch
	- rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 map duo3d_camera 100
	- rviz
