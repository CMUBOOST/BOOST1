Running the CRL Calibration Check Utility

  (1) Run Camera Calibration

   Before the calibration check program can be run, the MultiSense-SL
   ROS driver must be started.  The driver is normally started by
   executing the command "roslaunch multisense_bringup multisense.launch"
   after sourcing the appropriate setup.bash file.  For more information,
   please refer to the MultiSense-SL ROS Driver Manual, which is available
   from
   http://docs.carnegierobotics.com

   Next, navigate to the multisense_cal_check directory and execute the command

      ./cal_check

   Note: a process_bags.py file in the multisense_cal_check directory.

   ./cal_check <options>
   usage: ./cal_check <options>
   Where <options> are
       -b <bag_dir>         specifies the directory to save bag files. (default='.')
       -o <out_dr>          specifies the directory to save the calibration results
       -c                   do not remove temporary directory
       -h                   get help
